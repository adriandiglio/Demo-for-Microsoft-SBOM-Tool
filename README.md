# General

Just testing the Microsoft SBOM Tool and the CycloneDX BOM GitHub action, comparing their output

Microsoft SBOM Tool uses [Component Detection](https://github.com/microsoft/component-detection/blob/main/docs/detectors/pip.md) to detect pip components.
[CycloneDX BOM GitHub action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/cyclonedx-python-generate-sbom) just reads the requirements.txt file.

Copied code from https://github.com/geekcomputers/Python/tree/master/stone_paper_scissor for this test
